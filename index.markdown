        <h1>Our Vision</h1>
        <p>The newly renovated Liberty Theater, once a cornerstone of Main Street, is the center of arts and humanities activities in the Lewis-Clark Valley. By 2025, activities such as film screenings, concerts, dance recitals, and lectures will bring people from throughout the region to the theater to enjoy arts and humanities in an environment of inclusion.</p>
